# disgit
A cloudflare worker script which provides better github->discord webhooks than the built in discord webhook executor.

This repository is based on [JRoy/disgit](https://github.com/JRoy/disgit), deploying to IntellectualSites' CF workers via GitHub actions.

## Installation
1. Go to your cloudflare worker dashboard by clicking [here](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/workers) 
   and create a new worker.
1. Copy all the code from [disgit.js](https://github.com/JRoy/disgit/blob/master/disgit.js) and paste it into 
   the script window of your worker.
1. Click `Save and Deploy` and confirm your deployment.
1. Create a new webhook in your GitHub repository/organization settings.
1. Paste your worker's url into the `Payload URL` field and append `(webhook id)/(webhook token)` to the end.
   * For example if you had the worker url `https://my-worker.test.workers.dev` and the discord webhook url 
     `https://discord.com/api/webhooks/840438712203557422/8H3D57RQzftJmhw9VfEaLFLABjItuDScjU-c_nYKffb1hTlktLapwd`,
     the payload url you should have in the GitHub webhook form is 
     `https://my-worker.test.workers.dev/840438712203557422/8H3D57RQzftJmhw9VfEaLFLABjItuDScjU-c_nYKffb1hTlktLapwd`.
1. Set the `Content type` to `application/json`
1. You can configure the events to whichever you would like to receive. *Remember that some events require you to
   explicitly pick them in "`Let me select individual events`" and will not send with the "`Send my everything`"
   option.*
1. Click `Add webhook`.
1. That's it, you're all setup, and your webhooks should start coming in.
